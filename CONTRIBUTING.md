# Contributing to QGIS Full Motion Video
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've UI changed, update the documentation and screenshots.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GNU General Public License v3.0
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://github.com/All4Gis/QGISFMV/blob/master/LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/All4Gis/QGISFMV/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/All4Gis/QGISFMV/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
We use [Coding Standards](https://github.com/All4Gis/QGISFMV/blob/master/CodingStandards.md)

## License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its GNU General Public License v3.0.
